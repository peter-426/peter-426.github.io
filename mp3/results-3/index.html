<h1> Results 3 </h1>

Using NN with 10 hidden nodes.

<h2> The false positive problem (FP) </h2>

<h3> Four classes of examples, class 5 is new </h3>

Accuracy on the four classes: percent error: <b>73.6%</b>. <br>
Note: <b>y axis scales vary</b> to better show waveform shapes,<br>
mean amplitudes in each row may be very different.<br>
<br>
The NN is confused by classes 2 and 3 (rows 2 and 3) because their<br>
waveforms are similar, and because the NN has seen about the same <br>
number of each (spike counts are similar).
<br><br>
The NN was not trained or tested on the 105 class 5 (row 5) waveforms <br> 
at this point.

<h3> Test the NN on the 105 new class 5 waveforms. </h3>
The FP rate with threshold p >= 0.90 for class 5 waveforms was 1.0. <br>
The NN fails on this task because it classifies the new spike waveforms <br>
as members one of the four known classes based on similarity even if the <br>
most similar class is not very similar at all.   In fact, a test input of<br>
all zeros might be classified with a p >= 0.90. <br>
