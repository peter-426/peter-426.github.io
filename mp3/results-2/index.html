<h1> Results 2 </h1>
<h2> hc-1, data from four experiments </h2>
Four experiments, spike waveforms recorded on four channels per intracellular spike times (GT = ground truth).<br>
All waveform plots in the same row belong to the same experiment and class.
<list>
<li> Class 1: d533101.dat 
<li> Class 2: d561103.dat 
<li> Class 3: d611107.dat
<li> Class 4: d1453103.dat
</list>
<br>
Although these class 3 and 4 waveforms are not distinguishable to the human eye, <br>
the neural network appears to do a surprisingly good job of classifying them in a  <br>
test set after being trained on examples, but in reality this training set is biased<br>
by the number examples in class 3 (243 per channel) versus class 4 (1636 per channel).

<hr>
Using NN with 10 artificial neurons to classify extracelluar spike waveforms from biological neurons.
<list>
<li> Class 1: d533101.dat 
<li> Class 2: d561103.dat 
<li> Class 3: d561104.dat 
<li> Class 4: d1453103.dat
<li> Class 5: d611107.dat (new data from a separate experiment)
</list>
<br>
The new class 5 waveforms are in row 5 in the figure below.<br>
These waveforms were not used as training examples, and yet <br>
they were "recognized" as class 4 waveforms ... not surprising.
