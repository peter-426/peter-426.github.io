FtsZ and CoaD have known active sites.   These are located where the organic 
ligand (green) is bound to the surface of a pocket in FtsZ and CoaD.   In fact, the largest
pocket on a protein usually contains an active site.   An active site is analogous to a lock, while
the organic ligand is analogous to a "key" that fit the lock.  In theory, a chemical compound (ligand) that binds 
strongly at or near the active site could be used as a drug to inhibit the function of protein; it 
might have antimicrobial properties.
<p>
While images (a) and (b) show FtsZ and CoaD with their organic ligands, images (c) and (d)
show FtsZ's pocket with its organic ligand and a very similar chemical compound docked by <a href=http://vina.scripps.edu >AutoDock Vina.</a>
Vina is a relatively new program for drug discovery, molecular docking, and virtual screening.
<p>
Although Vina has been tested extensively for accuracy by other researchers, images (c) and (d) show that Vina 
does a good job of positioning ligands very close to where they would bind in reality, as opposed to in the computer. 
And, we hasten to add, we found that Vina does indeed offer high performance, enhanced accuracy, and ease of use.
