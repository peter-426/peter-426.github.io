  <td>First we acquired protein sequence data, and blasted the query sequences against the subject proteomes.
  BLAST attempts to align pairs of sequences such that a scoring function is maximized.  Very similar sequences
  probably share a common ancestral sequence, which suggests that they have the same or similar function.  Sequences 
  with a common ancestor are <i>homologous</i>.  The threshhold E and percent identity were used to <b>filter out</b> 
  most alignment pairs.   
  <p>
  Second we aligned multiple sequences using <a href=http://www.drive5.com/muscle  >MUSCLE</a>.
  Multiple sequence alignment algorithms assume that the sequences being aligned are homologous.  
  By aligning many homologous sequences we identified which specific residues are important to a set of similar proteins.
  These residues, known as <i>motifs</i>, may be far apart in the sequence but close together in 3D space (Zvelebil and Baum, 2008).  
  They often coincide with an active site and, coincidentally, a good drug target. 
  <p>
  Third we mapped conservation scores from the MSAs to each broadly conserved <i>B. subtilis</i> protein.
  Of course, the quality of the conservation scores was limited by the quality of the MSA.
