Probable active sites?   Image (a) shows YwtF with a highly conserved region (all red).  It appears
to be functionally important but lacks a substantial pocket.   RacE as shown
below in (c) and (d) does not show a highly conserved region or a substantial pocket.  
However, many highly conserved residues are present, as shown in (e)   
where RacE was rendered as lines using <a href=https://www.pymol.org  target=_top  >PyMOL</a>.
