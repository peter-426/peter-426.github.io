Bacteria come in many shapes and colors (due to dyes), 
as these <a href=bacteria-1.html >pictures</a> show.  Some are helpful while are others are pathogenic and may cause 
illness or even death.  The development of antibiotics was one of the biggest medical achievements of the 20th century.  
Unfortunately, some pathogenic bacteria have evolved to  resist penicillin and many other antibiotics.
For more general information,  Wikipedia provides an extensive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria" >article</a> 
about bacteria.
<p>  
I used <b>comparative genomics</b> to identify bacterial proteins as potential drug targets, and  
<b>virtual screening</b> to identify chemical compounds that bind strongly to those proteins.  
Chemical compounds were selected for lab tests and measured for their antimicrobial properties.
