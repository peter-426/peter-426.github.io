In general, conserved residues tend to be near or at known active sites.   The proteins shown below 
were colored according to the conservation scores calculated by <a href=http://www.jalview.org/ >Jalview</a>, 
which was also used to visualize the multiple sequence alignments produced by <a href=http://www.drive5.com/muscle/ > 
MUSCLE </a>.   But conservation is not the only indicator of an active site;  in most cases the largest pocket/cavity 
is the active site.   Images (a) and (c), rendered by <a href=http://www.pymol.org>PyMOL</a>, 
clearly show a highly conserved region with a large pocket; they
are the <a href=vs-organic-ligands.html >known active sites </a> of FtsZ and CoaD.
