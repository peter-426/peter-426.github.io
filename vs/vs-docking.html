<i>Docking</i> refers to the process of positioning a small molecule (ligand), such as a chemical compound
that could potentially be used as a drug, on a protein's surface.  However, some ligands have a greater affinity for
a given protein (receptor) than others and finding the exact position (aka pose) during simulated docking on a computer
requires that the computer try many positions before the best position is found.  Best in this context
means the position where the ligand binds with the lowest energy (measured in kcal/mol). 
And we must try thousands (or even millions) of ligands to find the best ligand.  This is a bit like trying to 
find a key that fits an unknown lock.  Try enough keys and one might fit.  
<p>
<i>Virtual screening</i> refers to the process of docking many chemical compounds with a target protein
<i>in silico</i> to eliminate large numbers of compounds from further consideration and ranking
remaining compounds from most to least promising (Kitchen <i>et al.</i>, 2004).
