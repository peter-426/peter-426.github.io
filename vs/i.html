Bacteria come in many shapes (and colors thanks to the dyes used to help study them), 
as these <a href=bacteria-1.php > pictures  </a> show.  Some are helpful while are others are pathogenic and may cause 
illness or even death.  The development of antibiotics was one of the biggest medical achievements of the 20th centrury.  
Unfortunately, some pathogenic bacteria have evolved such that they can resist penecillin and many other antibiotics.
Their impact on health is the subject of these excellent <a href=bacteria-2.php > videos </a>.
For more general information,  Wikipedia provides an extensive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria" > article  </a> 
about bacteria.

In recent research we used <b>comparative genomics</b> to identify bacterial proteins that are probably good drug targets,  
<b>virtual screening</b> to identify chemical compounds that bind strongly to those proteins and, finally, 
we selected chemical compounds for testing in the lab where they can be measured for their antimicrobial properties.  
The research menu on the left provides a link to a <a href=summary.php >  summary </a>  of our work, 
followed by links to background information and annotated images of our preliminary results.
