Our results indicated that ligands tend to bind most strongly in pockets with conserved residues.
<p> 
To validate our results we docked a subset of the NPD ligands (about 10,777) in two search spaces: (1)
where we expected the best scores, and (2) where we expected the worst scores (based on conservation).  
<p>
The images on the left (a..d) show ligands docked by <a href=http://vina.scripps.edu >Vina</a> in a search space centered on an area
characterized by low conservation.   Consequently, we expected the top scores for each
protein to be worse in this case than in <a href=vs-1.html >the case</a> where we docked ligands in search space 
that contained known or predicted active sites.   
Images (a) and (b) are just as we expected -- the scores are worse (they are less negative) than the same ligands docked 
on the "front".  
<p>
However, images (c) and (d) show that ligands scored better at the "back".  
We have been focussing on conservation but surface topology is important too.
Image (c) shows a ligand that scores much better docking at the "back" than the "front".
This appears to be due to a deep pocket with moderate conservation.  The intensely conserved area 
shown in image (g) lacks a substantial pocket, which indicates that conservation is not the only thing that matters.
Images (d) and (h) are ambiguous -- neither presents an obvious active site -- nonetheless the binding site is proximate
to conserved residues.
