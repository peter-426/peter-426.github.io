Docking refers to the process of positioning a small molecule (aka ligand), such as a chemical compound
that might be used as a drug, on a protein's surface.  However, some ligands have a greater affinity for
a given protein than others and finding the exact position (aka pose) during simulated docking on a computer
requires that the computer try many positions before the best one is found.  And we must try thousands
(or even millions) of ligands to find the best one.  This is a bit like trying to find a key that fits an unknown 
lock.  Try enough keys and one might fit!
